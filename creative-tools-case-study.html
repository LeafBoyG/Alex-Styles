      <h1>Designing Tools for Creative Professionals</h1>
      <p>A case study exploring a simplified, integrated digital environment for creative workflows.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>We observed that creative professionals often use a complex array of disconnected tools to achieve their goals. This can lead to inefficiencies, context switching, and a steep learning curve, especially for new users.</p>
      <p>Our objective was to explore the design of a simplified, integrated digital environment that supports common creative tasks, reducing friction and allowing users to focus on their creative output.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Approached It</h2>
      <p>We focused on identifying the core user needs within a creative workflow, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Image manipulation:</strong> Import, crop, and resize images.</li>
        <li><strong>Vector drawing:</strong> Precise control over shapes and paths.</li>
        <li><strong>Colour selection:</strong> Intuitive access to a wide range of colour options.</li>
        <li><strong>File management:</strong> Simple ways to save, open, and export work.</li>
        <li><strong>Zoom and navigation:</strong> Easy methods to view and move around the canvas.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We then designed a series of modular interface components that could be combined to meet these needs, prioritising clarity and direct manipulation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Modular Interface Panels</h2>
      <p>Instead of a single, overwhelming interface, we conceptualised distinct, movable panels for different functions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Image Insertion Panel:</strong> A clear placeholder for adding images, with options for placement and scaling.</li>
        <li><strong>Vector Pen Tool:</strong> A dedicated panel for precise path drawing, featuring anchor points and Bézier curve handles that are immediately visible and interactive.</li>
        <li><strong>Colour Picker:</strong> A compact, comprehensive colour selection tool supporting CMYK, RGB, and a visual spectrum for quick adjustments.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Consistent Navigation & Controls</h2>
      <p>Across all panels, we maintained a consistent visual language for controls:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Menu Bar:</strong> Familiar "File," "Edit," and "Image" menus for common actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Zoom Tool:</strong> A prominent magnify icon for quick detail inspection.</li>
        <li><strong>Draggable Handles:</strong> Clear indicators for resizing and moving panels.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Visual Clarity and Feedback</h2>
      <p>The aesthetic leans towards a clean, minimalist design with white/grey panels against a purple background. This helps the user focus on content and tools without unnecessary clutter. Interactive elements, like the active anchor point in the vector tool, provide immediate visual feedback.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Outcome</h2>
      <p>This exploration demonstrates how a well‑structured, component‑based design approach can simplify complex creative tasks. By breaking down the workflow into manageable, intuitive modules, we reduce cognitive load and enhance the user's ability to create efficiently. Essential tools remain readily available without overwhelming the user, supporting a smoother creative process.</p>
