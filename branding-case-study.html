      <h1>Building a Visual Identity for Castro Capital</h1>
      <p>A case study on creating a simple, robust identity system to establish purpose and credibility.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>We were tasked with creating a clear and consistent visual identity for a new organisation, <strong>Castro Capital</strong>.</p>
      <p>The main user need was for the organisation's audience—partners, investors, and clients—to immediately understand its purpose and credibility. Previously, there was no single system, which could lead to inconsistent and untrustworthy communications.</p>
      <p>Our goal was to build a simple, robust identity system that could be applied easily by their team across all materials, both print and digital.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Approached It</h2>
      <p>We focused on creating a small number of reusable components and clear guidelines. This avoids ambiguity and ensures the identity is applied correctly every time.</p>
      <p>The system is built on 3 core elements:</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1. A Defined Colour Palette</h2>
      <p>We established a strict and simple palette.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary:</strong> A deep blue acts as the base for all communications. It provides a serious, stable foundation.</li>
        <li><strong>Accent:</strong> A single accent colour, orange, is used sparingly to draw attention to key information, such as a headline or a call to action.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutral:</strong> Black and off-white are used for text and background, ensuring high contrast and legibility.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By limiting the colour options, we make it easier for users to apply the identity correctly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. A Clear Typographic Hierarchy</h2>
      <p>Readability was the primary goal. We selected a single, robust sans-serif typeface for all headings. The weight and size are defined in a simple scale to create a clear hierarchy of information on the page. This helps users scan documents and find what they need quickly.</p>
      <p>Body copy uses a standard, legible font to make long-form text easy to read.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. A Consistent Layout</h2>
      <p>All documents are built on a simple grid structure. This provides consistency, whether the user is viewing a letterhead or a brochure. It ensures information is presented in a predictable way, which helps to build trust and understanding.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Outcome</h2>
      <p>The result is a flexible but highly consistent identity system. It allows the Castro Capital team to produce new documents that are instantly recognisable and professional.</p>
      <p>By focusing on clarity, consistency, and ease of use, we have provided a system that meets the organisation's needs and serves its users effectively.</p>
